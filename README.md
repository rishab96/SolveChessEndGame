# rishab96-vickiniu-zherbst-project

For our project, we are planning to build two player battleship. Specifically, we are planning to use lasers and phototransistors to allow two pi's to send messages to eachother. 
We plan to use 4 lasers. With one laser acting as clock, and the other acting as data for each pi. We will then send commands as to which battleship position to attack back and forth until the game is over, displaying the progress to a screen.
